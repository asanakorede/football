  <h1 class="lol" > <u> Basketball </u> </h1>

  <h3> <span class="a1" >Basketball</span> began with its invention in 1891 in <span class="a2" >Springfield, Massachusetts</span>, by Canadian 
    physical education instructor <span class="a3" >James Naismith</span> as a less injury-prone sport than football. </h3>

<h3>Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.
The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in American and then in other 
other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed</h3>

<h3>The American <span class="a4" >National Basketball Association</span> (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar
enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture</h3>
