     <p>Soccer is a sport played globally across different countries by male and female, the young and old and even the youths.</p> 
     <p>Professional soccer is a game played with a simple football by 11 players(10 outfield players and a single goalkeeper) and the game is officiated by 4 officials namely; a referee, an assistant referee, a video assistant referee, and a linesman. </p>
     <p>The referee makes use of his whistle, stopwatch and the cards(yellow and red). He makes use of the cards when he sees any unsportsman like behaviour by the players. The linesman's job is simply to walk along the sidelines and raise his flag when he detects players running into an "offside position". The assistant referees look out for anything the referee doesn't see. </p>
     <p>The beautiful game is played only for 90 minutes and in 2 halves, the first half and second half are played for 45 minutes each with a 15 minutes break after the first half.</p> 
     <p> The game allows different fans from all over the world sit in strategically mapped positions in the stadium and cheer for the players and in the process, express their passion.</p>
