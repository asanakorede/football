      <div class="content">
         <p>Soccer is a sport played globally across different countries by male and female, the young and old and even
            the
            youths.</p>
         <p>Professional soccer is a game played with a simple football by 11 players(10 outfield players and a single
            goalkeeper) and the game is officiated by 4 officials namely; a referee, an assistant referee, a video
            assistant
            referee, and a linesman. </p>
         <p>The referee makes use of his whistle, stopwatch and the cards(yellow and red). He makes use of the cards
            when
            he
            sees any unsportsman like behaviour by the players. The linesman's job is simply to walk along the sidelines
            and
            raise his flag when he detects players running into an "offside position". The assistant referees look out
            for
            anything the referee doesn't see. </p>
         <p>The beautiful game is played only for 90 minutes and in 2 halves, the first half and second half are played
            for
            45
            minutes each with a 15 minutes break after the first half.</p>
         <p> The game allows different fans from all over the world sit in strategically mapped positions in the stadium
            and
            cheer for the players and in the process, express their passion.</p>

         <ul> <em><b>Football's top 5 leagues are:</b></em>
            <li>Premier league(England)</li>
            <li>Serie A(Italy)</li>
            <li>Bundesliga(Germany)</li>
            <li>Ligue 1(France)</li>
            <li>La Liga(Spain)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The beautiful game has evolved and new changes are implemented regularly. However, the concept of the game
            still
            remains as 11 players working together as a team to put the ball in the opposition's net. The game does so
            much
            more than entertain, but brings people from different parts of the world. The game has created so many
            legends
            who
            consistently delivered for so many years. </p>
         <ul> <em><b>Some notable football legends are:</b></em>

         <p>In football, two major trophies stand out. For club level, the <a class="acr"
               href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/">Uefa Champions League</a> is regarded as the most
            prestigious trophy and there's always a chance for a new team to get their hands on this incredibly alluring
            trophy every year. For national team level, the most prestigious trophy a country can win is the Fifa World
            Cup
            and there's always a chance for different nations to win every four years.</p>
         The current holders of the Uefa Champions League are Manchester City while the current holders of the World Cup
         are Argentina.
